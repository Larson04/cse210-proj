    Version Control is basically having constant backups of the file you are working on.
    If you are working on a code and you stop for the day, you would save the file and back it up to where ever the file will 
be saved. The next time you work on the file you can update it when you're done, but if fo some reason you don't like what 
you did the last time, you can go back to the last version of the file and start over from where you were happy with the
code. It helps that most version control systems allow you to put a comment on the file update so you know where or how 
far back you need to go. You add the comment in the git commit command for Git.
    For example, if you are working on a website for a client, you can save each version, and if there is a new version
that the client doesn't like, you can go back and pull up the last version they liked and start over from there. Or if you
are working in a team, and someone bugs up the code on accident, there is a version without the bugs that you can go back
to if you can't figure out how to fix it.
